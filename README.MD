## Project use

This is a weather app which shows the weather of your current location.
You can check the current, hourly, and daily weather and some extra information about the weather.

You can either use your current location or you can input a latitude and longitude to see the weather there if available.
You can also click on the map to ask for the weather of the location there.

## How to start

Clone the repository on your local machine.

You need your own api key from openweatherapi to use this app, create a file named config.js. Add an object with name being apiKey and set the key as your api key

Click in one of the three folders and they each have their own html, css, and js file there is no global one for all of them but they all connect with eachother.

Run the app.
