## Project use

This is a weather app which shows the weather of your current location.
You can check the current, hourly, and daily weather and some extra information about the weather.

You can either use your current location or you can input a latitude and longitude to see the weather there if available.
You can also click on the map to ask for the weather of the location there.

## How to start

Just clone the repository and run it on your local machine.

Click in one of the three folders and they each have their own html, css, and js file there is no global one for all of them but they all connect with eachother.

## Why this was built

This project was built to test my js skills, as well as getting used to html and css.

## Third parties used

Leaflet.js was used for the map and openweathermap was used for the weather data.
